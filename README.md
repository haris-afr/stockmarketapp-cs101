# stockmarketapp-cs101
Stock market app by Haris Afridi, Ahsan Ali Shaikh, Daniyal Ali, Usman Musawar for CS101 SE.

This project uses the C++ & the SFML library for C++ and was made in Visual Studio and Dev C++

NOTE: This repo is purely for documentational pourposes, currently there is no easy way to get this program running by cloning the repo as it uses absolute positioning in the Visual Studio set-up.

The recommended way to get it running is to set up an SFML project in Visual Studio using a guide and copy paste the code and the images into the directory.
Beyond this, this repository is purely for reference pourposes only. The code written by us is inside the StockMarketApp folder in the root dir.

News Algorithm - Daniyal (CS STOCK MARKET PROJECT.cpp)
Extremes Price Change Code - Usman (Price change.cpp)
